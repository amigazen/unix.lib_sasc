Short:    'unix emulation' library for SAS/C

Requires: util/misc/fifolib38_2.lha, util/shell/APipe_37_7.lha

This is the unix compatibility library which I used for porting
various packages (ghostscript, ghostview, xfig, xv, xdvi, tar).
The library is written for SAS/C 6.55+ and provides a more unix-like
environment for programs compiled with it, along with a number of C
functions which I needed to compile the above programs. These are
either new or replacements for similar functions in the SAS/C library
(where these functions lacked some features or were buggy).
The library has also support for programs using sockets, but you need
also AmiTCP as it relies on bsdsocket.library to provide this
functionality.

In the scc directory of this archive you can also find a front end to sc
which uses a semi-unix syntax. It is very useful if you use a Makefile
written for GNU make as it solves a small problem related to passing
quoted arguments from GNU make to programs not using ixemul.library.
